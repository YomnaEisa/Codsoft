# Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Welcome to the Titanic survival prediction project! The dataset is sourced from the historic Titanic event, containing information about individual passengers. Among the key attributes are age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and, most importantly, whether they survived or not.

## Overview
This project revolves around building a predictive model to determine a passenger's likelihood of survival on the Titanic. The dataset offers valuable insights into the demographics and socio-economic factors that influenced survival rates.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we embark on a journey to understand the intricacies of this dataset. EDA involves techniques that allow us to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data. By delving into these details, we aim to gain valuable perspectives that will guide us in constructing an accurate predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains detailed information about the passengers, including: <br>

PassengerId  - ID assigned to each Passenger.<br>
Age          - Passenger's Age.<br>
Pclass       - Passenger's ticket's class (1st, 2nd or 3rd class tickets).<br>
Name         - Passenger's name.<br>
Sex          - Passenger's sex.<br>
SibSp        - Number of Passenger's siblings/spouses onboard.<br>
Parch        - Number of Passenger's parents/children onboard. <br>
Ticket       - Passenger's ticket's ID.<br>
Fare         - How much the Passenger paid for their ticket.<br>
Cabin        - The cabin where the Passenger is staying.<br>
Embarked     - The location where the Passenger embarked on the ship.<br>
Survived     - Whether they survived or not (0 = did not survive or 1 survived ).<br>
