# Cars Price Prediction Project
Welcome to the Cars Price Prediction Project!
As a vehicle salesperson, understanding the potential spending capacity of consumers is crucial for creating personalized sales strategies. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that estimates the overall amount customers are likely to spend. To achieve this, we will leverage a diverse set of customer characteristics including their name, email, country, gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth.

## Project Overview
By analyzing these attributes, we intend to uncover valuable insights that can guide sales efforts toward a more targeted and effective approach. This EDA process will lay the foundation for the development of a predictive model, enabling us to better serve customers and optimize sales strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains detailed information about the customer, including:<br>
customer name<br>      
customer e-mail<br>           
country<br>         
gender<br>              
age<br>              
annual Salary<br>          
credit card debt<br>       
net worth<br>      
car purchase amount<br>
